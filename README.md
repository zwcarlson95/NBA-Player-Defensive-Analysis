NBA Player Defensive Stats Analysis (2022-2023 Season)

Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of NBA player defensive statistics for the 2022-2023 season. Utilizing Python and various data analysis libraries, the project aims to uncover insights into players' defensive capabilities and their impact on the game.

Data
The dataset comprises detailed player and team defensive metrics, including:

Minutes per game, blocks, steals, defensive rebounds, etc.
Advanced metrics like contested shots, deflections, and charges drawn.
Calculated statistics representing each player's contribution to their team's defensive efforts.
Player vs. player metrics to infer how players matchup defensively against the league's top offensive players.
